        <title>How I made $1000 in 1 Month on Craigslist</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
      Using nothing but craigslist, I made $1000 in 1 month. NO special skills or knowledge are required.

I've created a book that walks you through every step of the process and every pitfall so you can get up and running as quickly as possible.

I've already made $200 this weekend trading iPods, iPads, and iPhones, and you can too.

If you want to follow my process, pick up "How I Made $1000 in One Month on Craigslist" on Amazon.
